# Profit-prediction-of-50-startups-using-different-regression-algorithms 


Abstract:A company should always set a goal that should be achievable, otherwise, employees will not be able to work to their best potential if they find that the goal set by the company is unachievable. The task of profit prediction for a particular period is the same as setting goals. If we know how much profit we can make with the amount of R&D and marketing we do, then a business can make more than the predicted profit provided the predicted value is achievable. So, in this project, the task of profit prediction with machine learning using Python will be done. The profit earned by a company for a particular period depends on several factors like how much time and money a company spends on R&D, marketing and many more. So, for predicting the profit of a company for a particular period we need to train a machine learning model with a dataset that contains historical data about the profit generated by the company.


Objective: Developed a machine learning model to accurately predict the future profit of start-up businesses based on historical data, including research and development spend, administration costs, marketing spend, and state of operation, to aid in setting realistic goals and optimizing development strategies for improved decision-making by both administration and stakeholders.
